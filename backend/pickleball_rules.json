The court is divided into right/even and left/odd service courts and non-volley zones. (See Figure 2-1.) The ball is served diagonally across the net to the opponent\u2019s receiving court using an approved motion. The ball is struck back and forth across the net until a player fails to return the ball in accordance with the rules. Points are scored only by the serving side when the server or the server\u2019s team wins the rally, or the opposing side commits a fault. The server continues to serve, alternating service courts, until the serving side loses the rally or commits a fault. For matches that use the provisional rally scoring option, a point is scored by the player or team that wins each rally except game point can only be scored when serving. Typically, the first side scoring 11 points and leading by at least a 2-point margin wins. Pickleball can be played as singles or doubles.\n\nThe Players\nPickleball is a game that requires cooperation and courtesy.

USA Pickleball is committed to furthering the growth and development of pickleball among all players. USA Pickleball is the National Governing Body of American pickleball that formulates and interprets all the rules of the sport in a manner that preserves the traditional nature and character of the sport and the skills traditionally required to play the sport. All such decisions by USA Pickleball are final and not appealable. The purpose of the rulebook is to provide pickleball players with the rules necessary for recreational, social, organized league and tournament play. Some sections of this rulebook are designed to be used only for the conduct of USA Pickleball-sanctioned tournaments. A sanctioned tournament allows players to obtain a rating on a national or international basis. Non-sanctioned tournaments may also use these sections as guidelines. Tournament Directors for non-sanctioned tournaments may be flexible in the use of these guidelines to better fit the skills, ages, and diversity of their players. USA Pickleball enthusiastically encourages these non-sanctioned tournaments to promote knowledge and growth of the sport, and skill development, while having fun playing pickleball. USA Pickleball published the sport\u2019s first official rulebook in March 1984. I Comments and opinions are always welcome.

Preface The USA Pickleball Official Rulebook is the organization\u2019s most important product. It is the foundational document for the sport of pickleball and should be treated with the respect accorded the sport\u2019s founders and those who have written and approved rules over the years. Writing rules that are objective, clear and concise is difficult work. Because those involved in writing and/or approving rules come from different backgrounds and experiences, it is important to have rule writing priorities and guiding principles that help provide a measure of consistency from year to year. The following Rulebook Priorities and Guiding Principles were developed to guide rule writers and approvers in their important work. Priorities The following three priorities should be considered \u201ctests\u201d for any suggested rule change. Any suggested rule change should satisfy at least one of these three priorities, listed in order of importance: 1. The first priority is preserving the integrity of the sport, one that incorporates the elements of fun, cooperation, courtesy, and competition. This priority pays homage to those who developed the sport in 1965 and those who have written and approved rule changes over the years. 2. The second priority is what is collectively best for the players. This priority examines rule changes for rule changes from the standpoint of minimizing player disagreements, making it easier to learn the sport, teach the sport, and play the sport, while also allowing for moderate innovation as player skills and equipment develop and evolve. 3. The third priority is what\u2019s best for officiating. It \u201ctests\u201d rule changes to make it less likely conflicts will occur between players as well as between players and officials. Guiding Principles The USA Pickleball Official Rulebook covers a wide variety of rules that cover the court and equipment, recreational and social play as well as tournament play, officiated and non- officiated. The following are Guiding Principles for those writing and approving rules. To the extent possible, rules should: 1. Apply to all levels and categories of players; recreational and social players, as well as professional and amateur tournament players (officiated and non- officiated). Specific rules for a single category of player, for example, the pro level player, should be approved after careful consideration and examination of how the rule change might impact the sport beyond the pro level of competition. 2. Be written with a deterministic focus, i.e., from the standpoint of \u201cif this occurs, this is what happens.\u201d If something is not allowed or should not happen, the consequences (for example: replay, fault, technical warning, etc.) should be provided as part of the rule. 3. Center on that which should not occur, not on what is permitted or allowed. Attempts to include rules unnecessarily lengthy Rulebook. 4. Avoid ambiguity, player discretion, or referee judgment-related rules. Such rules invite disagreements and different interpretations. To this end, when a key word is used to describe when a rule applies, the word should be defined as either a part of the rule or in the Definition Section of the Rulebook. 5. Allow equipment manufacturers to innovate, as long as such innovation does not overwhelm or outpace the average player\u2019s ability to keep up with the speed and difficulty of the sport. Equipment-related rule changes should be given particularly close scrutiny because of their precedent-setting potential. 6. Have an element of precedent accorded to them. Change for change\u2019s sake should be avoided to avoid frustration among or a loss of confidence by players. 7. Allow for an appropriate degree of player innovation. Such innovation should maintain a healthy balance between historical rules that have been instrumental to the sport\u2019s growth and appeal. 8. Preserve the unique features and rules of the sport involving the Non-Volley Zone and the two-bounce rule and prevent one shot, one paddle, or type of play from dominating the sport. 9. Address a known issue or anticipate trends and needs of the sport before it becomes necessary. 10. Be subjected to reviews and comments by domestic and international stakeholders. 10 second rule 4.E service court 3.A.39; 2.B.4 Additional Balls 7.N side lines 2.B.2 Apparel 2.G Dead ball violation 2.G.4 definition 3.A.6 rules Section 8 Around the post (ATP) shot Distractions 11.M; 11.L.3 definition 3.A.7 Ball in play rule 11.J definition 3.A.1 Double bounce 3.A.8 Ball specifications 2.D Wheelchair play 1 cracked/broken 11.E (see also two-bounce rule) color 2.D.3 Double hit Calling the score 4.D definition 3.A.9 singles matches 4.I allowed 11.A doubles matches 4.J End selection rules 5.A.1 wrong score called 4.K Carry 3.A.2 Ejection 3.A.10 deliberate carry 7.L scoring guidelines 12.H from tournament 13.M Change of ends 5.B Equipment prob.
